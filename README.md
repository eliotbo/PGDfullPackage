# PGDfullPackage
MATLAB code for quantum tomography through Projected Gradient Descent 

See example1.m and example2.m

Example2 can be used by an experimentalist who wants to run the PGD
algorithms on their data. Example data is included in a subfolder called
simData: A.mat, data.mat and rho.mat.

Algorithms are from https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.09531
